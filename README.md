Pokemon berries app with service worker.  
This small app was developed just to learn the fundamentals of service workers.  
The app uses simple HTML and CSS page with calls [PokeApi's](https://pokeapi.co/) berries [API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/berry/) to get  
the list of berries.  
The berries also have additional information which gets displayed on the click of individual berries in a tablular format.  
The service workers cache the API requests which allows users to visit the pages which they have previously visited  
in the **offline** mode also.
